1.	Load some initial data (as discussed above) into the database tables that you created in Part 2 of the assignment. You can either write a loading program, or use SQL/PLUS (insert command), or use SQL/FORMS. Your data should be kept in files so that it can easily be reloaded during debugging. The data format should be designed by you. (Note: You can also use the transactions created by you in item 3 below to load some of the data).
